# Beginner Programming
**Summary:** My programming courses from my intro to C++ class at community college. It's kind of fun to look back and see how far I've come and I want a place to have it up online, even if it's nothing like what I do now. Measuring how much I've leveled up is really great haha. So, yeah. Sorry if these programs literally are baby codes. I started programming in 2013 but I was able to only find my baby code from 2014 for this class since I had to retake it. I know there are a lot of comments but I don't really wanna remove them or touch them. I know the logic behind a lot of these are really redundant but I was learning at the time and I wanted to reiterate everything I was doing and make sure it did what it was supposed to do.

*To run in terminal:*
```
* g++ 2AMilesperGallon.cpp -o main
* ./main
```

## 2BStockLoss.cpp
**Kathryn bought 600 shares of stock at a price of $21.77 per share. A year later she sold them for just $16.44 per share. Write a program that calculate and displays the following:** </br>
**1. The total amount paid for the stock.** </br>
**2. The total amount received from selling the stock.** </br>
**3. The total amount of money she lost.** </br>
*To run in terminal:*
```
* g++ 2BStockLoss.cpp -o main
* ./main
```

## 2CEnergyDrinkConsumption.cpp
**A soft drink company recently surveyed 12,467 of its customers and found that approximately 14 percent of those surveyed purchase one or more energy drinks per week. Of those customers who purchase energy drinks, approximately 64 percent of them prefer citrus flavored energy drinks. Write a program that displays the following:** </br>
**1. The approximate number of customers in the survey who purchase one or more energy drinks per week.** </br>
**2. The approximate number of customers in the survey who prefer citrus flavored energy drinks.** </br>
*To run in terminal:*
```
* g++ 2CEnergyDrinkConsumption.cpp -o main
* ./main
```

## monthlypayment3.cpp
**Rate is the monthly interest rate, which is the annual interest rate divided by 12. (A 12 percent annual interest would be 1 percent monthly interest.) N is the number of payments and L is the amount of the loan. Write a program that asks for these values and displays a report similar to the following:** </br>
**1. Loan Amount: $ 10000.00** </br>
**2. Monthly Interest Rate: 1%** </br>
**3. Number of Payments: 36** </br>
**4. Monthly Payment: $ 332.14** </br>
**5. Amount Paid Back: $ 11957.15** </br>
**6. Interest Paid: $ 1957.15** </br>
*To run in terminal:*
```
* g++ monthlypayment3.cpp -o main
* ./main
```
 
## 4employeepayment.cpp
**An employee is paid at a rate of $16.78 per hour for regular hours worked in a week. Any hours over that are paid at the overtime rate of one and one-half times that. From the worker’s grosspay, 6% is withheld for Social Security tax, 14% is withheld for federal income tax. 5% is withheld for state income tax, and $10 per week is withheld for union dues. If the worker has three or more dependents, then an additional $35 is withheld to cover the extra cost of health insurance beyond what the employer pays. Write a program that will read in the number of hours worked in a week and the number of dependents as input and that will then output the worker’s gross pay, each withholding amount, and the net take-home pay for the week.** </br>
*To run in terminal:*
```
* g++ 4employeepayment.cpp -o main
* ./main
```
 
## cellularphonecompany.cpp
*Note: This was a group project.* </br>
**Write a program that calculates and prints the bill for a cellular telephone company. The company offers two types of service: regular and premium. Its rates vary, depending on the type of service. The rates are computed as follows:** </br>
**1. Regular Service: $10.00 plus first 50 minutes are free. Charges for over 50 minutes are $.20 per minutes.** </br>
**2. Premium Service: $25.00 plus: a. For calls made from 6:00AM to 6:00PM, the first 75 minutes are free; charges for more than 75 minutes are $.10 per minute. b. For calls made from 6:00PM to 6:00AM, the first 100 minutes are free; charges for more than 100 minutes are $.05 per minute.** </br>
**Your program should prompt the user to enter an account number, a service code (type char), and the number of minutes the service was used. A service code or r or R means regular service; a service code of p or P means premium service. Treat any other character as an error. Your program should output the account number, type of service number of minutes the telephone service was used, and the amount due from the user. For the premium service, the customer may be using the service during the day and the night. Therefore, to calculate the bill, you must ask the user to input the number of minutes the service was used during the day and the number of minutes the service was used during the night.** </br>
*To run in terminal:*
```
* g++ celularphonecompany.cpp -o main
* ./ main
```
Will add more from this class later...
